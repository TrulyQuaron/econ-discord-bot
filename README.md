This bot was made by Quaron.

INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO HOST THE BOT:

===

1. Download Python, preferably the latest version (link: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/) )
2. After you've finished setting up Python, head into the command prompt and type ***"py -3 -m pip install -U discord.py"***. If this doesn't work, you can also write "pip install discord.py".

&nbsp;	This will install the required packages to run the bot.

3\. Right click on the 'econ.json' file and empty it in case there is anything inside (DO NOT DELETE IT). I recommend doing the same for 'inventory.json'.

&nbsp;	To edit a .json file, right click on it and press 'Edit in Notepad'

4\. Run "main.py" and invite the bot using the link in the terminal! You should be set up and ready to go!





Setting up custom responses



---




Anything that seems like a response to you, you can edit. EDITING ANYTHING ELSE WILL MOST LIKELY BREAK THE CODE.

Anything behind a '#' is called a comment, and it is meant for you!



Have fun in editing your responses. Let me know if something doesn't work...




Setting up the shop


---



Obviously, items won't magically work the moment you add them to 'shop.json', but the very least you can do is add your own items to it. Here's how.



* Instead of 'item\_1', you must enter its ID, which will be displayed as an option when using the /buy command. This is crucial in the code as well.
  ***! ! ! WHEN ENTERING AN ID, MAKE SURE ALL THE LETTERS ARE LOWERCASE AND THE ID HAS NO SPACES, OTHERWISE THE CODE WILL BREAK ! ! !***
* Instead of 'Item 1', enter the name of your item. Unlike our previous instance with ID, you are allowed to use spaces and uppercase letters.
* Instead of '150', '50' or '300' (whatever is next to "amount":) put your own price for an item.

  To add a new item to the display, follow the same template as the previous three items. Mind the brackets {}{} :)











#### Once you do that ask me to make that item and I will do so :D
